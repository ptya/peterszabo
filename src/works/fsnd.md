Long since I started programming on the side, in the middle of 2018 I decided to go through Udacity's [Full Stack Web Developer program](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044). I finished it long before the estimated duration and got more solid knowledge in Python, sysadmin related works and databases along with a refresher on HTML, CSS and JS.

You can check out the [syllabus of the course](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/udacity-printer/production/syllabus/syllabus-nd004-4.0.0-en-us.pdf) and even check if [my degree is valid](https://confirm.udacity.com/7SNKKNPF) :)

There were several projects during the program and you can find some repos for those below.
