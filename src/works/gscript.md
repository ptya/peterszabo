Although not exactly web development, but during my ~7 years of being employed I always looked for ways to ease my work. It got really serious in the last 3 years where I wrote over 2.000 lines of code in Google Script.

I made project management spreadsheets connecting Jira, Gitlab, Monday and several other internal tools. Even handled calendar and mail alert systems. If there's a tool we as a team would need to use, I most probably integrated it in my system. :)

I really like these side projects.

Unfortunately there's no repo for this kind of work I could share as these are 100% complany related.
