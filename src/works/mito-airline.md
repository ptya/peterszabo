This project started as a way to test the new trial for new frontend developers for the company. I had so much fun with it I did not stop until I created the last pieces of details I could think of. The project was based on a provided GFX.

It is a web application using React framework to serve as a flight vendor site utilizing 3rd party API endpoints.

It features:
- Inputs with autosuggest
- Spring-physics based animations using [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/)
- 90%+ code coverage with tests using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
- Git hooks
